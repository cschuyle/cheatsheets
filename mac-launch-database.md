# Re-generate Mac launch database

### Use case:
You remove an app, but its association to a URL or file remains, so you can't open the file or URL

### Solution:

```
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
```

Then, restart.

I think the deal is that you canâ€™t populate the Launch Database yourself, or selectively remove items,
but if you nuke it then the system rebuilds it from whatever apps there are in various paths.
